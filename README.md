# Notes from the workshop of: _"Writing for scholarly journal"_ hosted by South African Journal of Science 

This is a ```Markdown``` file containing notes from the webinar of ```"The process of publication"```.   

South African Journal of Science is an **open source journal** without **PCA**.  

I've already hosted a git repository for these notes. You can contribute to it, and share it with anyone, This is the [link](https://github.com/mohamed-hachaichi/Scholarly_publication) for the repo. 

You can see the whole webinar on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBQK62_qCLw&t=455s) (~5h).

## 1. Writing: What the research tells us by *Chrissie Boughey*

-Successful writer now how to satisfies his reader (silence the reader/reviewer/editor). whereas an unsuccessful writer puzzles the reader. 

-Start by writing for yourself to know what you want to say (freewriting). Successful writers also use writing as a tool for learning. 

    How I can know what i think until I write it 

- You must know for whom you write, thesis examiners, readers of a journal

- As you wrote imagine the reaction of the reader to what you were saying 

        Write --> write --> rewrite --> draft -(imaginary conversation)-> redraft -(generative writing)-> write  

- Submit your article only when the reader is silenced 

- Editing phase is not included in the writing process

- Editing phase: polish the text to ensure it was technically perfect and stylistically appropriate 

- Set a time limit for writing (7 min) after that threshold you'll loose focus

*Literature review position:*
        - What this text agree/disagree with other papers I've read?
        - How does it related to my work?
        - What is interesting about this article? 
        - What do I agree/disagree with?  

## 2. Know your audience by *Linda Fick*

Article's title changes from a platform (journal, newspaper, blog, Twitter) to another (audience spectrum). 

## 3. Tips on publishing by *Leslie Swartz*

Speaks about general publication processes, and linking it to the South African Journal of Science and the relevance of the context, aims, and scoops of each journal. 

    * A lot of authors received bad critiques, and it is okay 

Some advice: 

* Always go for the best journal and work your way down - don't be modest 
* A reader does not read your article/thesis to estimate how smart you're, but they read it because they have to know what is going on in the field, and how does your work contributes to it. 

    * For Data analytics: Be very clear about what you can and can't say from your data (state the method and the limitations, understanding the limitation is a part of the discussions of your article).  

It is important to say only what the data is telling you, nothing more. Swartz gave a very good example: Three people (a mathematician, an applied mathematician and a physicist) went to mountains in Scotland and there a black sheep, the physicist said, *"I see that the sheep in Scotland are black"*, the applied mathematician replied: *"This is not really evidence-based, all you know is that some of the sheep are black in Scotland"*, the mathematician then said: *"No, no one knows that, if we actually look at the evidence in front of us, all we know that in Scotland at least one sheep, at least one side of which is black"*. All the three people have seen only one side of a sheep which was black, and therefore, *data scientists should not exaggerate in extrapolation*. When you write as an academic, be like a mathematician, state what you see/know, and what you don't know. 

Forget about the fancy structure of a thesis/article, and state clearly, as a first step, your article should be structured as follows: 

    - Why I did it?
    - How I did it?
    - What I found?
    - What it means? 

*Write less* while writing articles, with short sentences, active voice, words of one syllable, simplify as much as possible (Won a noble prize because the author simplifies a lot). 

When replaying to reviewers be polite, kind, and grateful. 

The hope: ```African scholarship is of a standard and quality -- promotion of local scholarship``. 

*The impact factor does not measure the good quality of a given journal, nor a number of a citation for a given article. The two most cited papers in South Africa are quite controversial. Notice that the impact factor is highly related to the field of the journal*.

## 4. Writing a title, keywords, and abstract to make your article discoverable by *Louise van Heerden*

How to use the title, keywords to refine a search (narrow down the scope).

How to write an abstract that search engines will find. 

- creat a search-engine-friendly article  
    - 1. **Title** 
    - short, no-abbreviations, and highlight the relevance of the article to the reader
    - keep in mind the audience of your article 
    - choose the words that pop up
    - 2. **Keywords** 
    - keywords not necessarily appear in the title 
    - use specific phenomena or issues (climate change, air pollution)
    3. **Abstract** 
    - appealing to the reader and make the reader wat to read the full article
    - follow the structure of: Why, How, What you did? What it means, and What you recommend? 

Structure of the abstract: 
    - abstract is not a summary of the research 
    - write the after you finish your article 
    - avoid new information and abbreviation 
    - ask a colleague to check your abstract 
    - read author guidelines of the selected journal 

Acknowledgments: some search databases do pick up these details, but they ignore the sources of fundings and details of people that contributed to their article. 

## 5. Metadata, Citations, and Bibliographies by *Susan Veldsman*

Metadata is data that describes the article's underlying data. 

Metadata can help to make your article discoverable (URL, DIO, date, git repos, ORCDE, citation record, affiliation, end of paper citations). 

## 6. Researcher identifiers, profiles, and social networks by *Nadia Grober*

it is important to have research ID (Scopus, ORCID, ResearchGate, GoogleScholar): 

    - build an online presence 
    - increase research impact 
    - snapshot your research impact 
    - get credit for your research (get cited)
