# Notes from the workshop of: _"Writing for scholarly journal"_ hosted by South African Journal of Science 

This is a ```Markdown``` file containing notes from the webinar of ```"The process of publication"```.   

South African Journal of Science is an **open source journal** without **PCA**.  

I've already hosted a git repository for these notes. You can contribute to it, and share it with anyone, This is the [link]() for the repo. 

## 1. Writing: What the research tells us by *Chrissie Boughey*



## 2. Know your audiance by **

## 3. Tips on publishing by *Leslie Swartz*

Speaks about general publication processes, and linking it to South African Journal of Science and the relevance of the context, aims and scoops of each journal. 

    * A lot of authors recieved bad critiques, and it is okay 

Some advies: 

* Always go for the best journal and work you way down - don't be modest 
* A reader do not read you article/thesis to estimate how smart you're, byt they read it because they have to now what is oing on in the field, and how does your work contribute to it. 

    * For Data analytics: Be very clear about what you can and can't say from you data (state the method and the limitations, uderstading the limitation is a part of the discussions of your article).  

It is important to say only what the data is telling you, nothing more. Swartz gave a very good example: Three people (a mathematicians, an applied mathematician and a physicist) went to moutains in Scotland and there a black sheep, the physisicts said, *"I see that the sheep in Scotland are black"*, the applied mathematician replaied: *"This is not really evident based, all you know is that some of the sheep are black in scostalnd"*, the mathematician then said: *"No, noone knows that, if we actually look at the evident in front of us, all we know that in scotland at least one sheep, at least one side of which is black"*. All the three people have seen only one side of a sheep which was black, and therefore, *data scientists should not exagerate in extrapolation*. When you write as an academic, be like a mathematician, state what you see/know, and what you don't know. 

Forget about the fancy structure of a thesis/article, and state clearnly, as a first step, you articvle should be structured as follows: 

    - Why I did it?
    - How I did it?
    - What I found?
    - What it means? 

*Write less* while writing articles, with short sentences, active voice, words of one syllable, simplfy as much as possible (Won a noble prize because of the author simplfies a lot). 

When replaying to reviewers be polite, kind and grateful. 

The hope: ```African schoolership is of a standard and quality -- promotion of local scholership```. 

    Impact factor does not a measure the good quality of a given journal, nor a number of citation for a given article. Two most cited papers in South Africa are quite controversal. Notice that impact factor is highly related to the field of the journal.

## 4. Writing a title, keywords, and abstract to make your article discoverable by *Louise van Heerden*

How to use title, keywords to refine search (norrw down the scope).

How to write an abstract that search engines will find. 

- creat a search-engine-friendly article  
    - 1. Title 
    - short, no-abbreviations, and highlight the relevence of the article to the reader
    - keep in mind the audiance of your article 
    - choose the words that pop up
    - 2. Keywords 
    - keywords not necessarly appreas in the title 
    - use specific phenomena or issues (climate change, air pollution)
    3. Abstract 
    - appealing to the reader and make the reader wat to read the full article 

Structure of the abstract: 
    - abstract is not a summary of the research 
    -
